# MicroBooNE-analysis-2021

 This code is an extension of the one used in [2111.10359](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10359) to include decaying-sterile neutrinos. It also inherits some functionality from the antineutrino analysis in [2301.12573](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12573).

This repository contains data files provided by the MicroBooNE collaboration in their data releases:
* inclusive (Wire-Cell) [data release](https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1953539) (including v3)
* CCQE (Deep Learning) [data release](https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1953568)

Also used are the files in the [2018 MiniBooNE data release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15055?context=nucl-ex#:~:text=The%20MiniBooNE%20experiment%20has%20provided,of%20the%20MiniBooNE%20data%20releases) as well as the 2020 data.

All other data files are obtained by digitizing plots available in the corresponding papers.
